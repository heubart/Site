My name's Sahir, and I'm a biostatistician who loves using numbers to solve tricky biological puzzles. I've done research and taught at McGill University, where I helped students out and got neck-deep in data. Afterwards, I worked at Deep Genomics as a Senior Research Scientist and helped identify new drug targets by analyzing whole-genome sequencing data. I'm proud to say that I wrote several R packages that have been used by over 200,000 people around the world â€“ gotta love open-source solutions! When I'm developing new methodologies, I always make sure they're both scientifically sound and easy to understand. These days, I'm using my statistical genetics expertise to help develop new drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry.



## Current Focus

I wish to inform visitors that I have stepped away from academia and am no longer taking on graduate students. My current endeavors are focused on applying my expertise in statistical genetics to support drug programs in the biopharmaceutical industry. This shift marks a new chapter in my career, where I aim to bridge the gap between advanced statistical methodologies and practical applications in drug development.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope it serves as a window into my professional journey and contributions to the field of biostatistics and genetic research.
