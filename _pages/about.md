I am Associate Director of Statistical Genetics at 5 Prime Sciences, and an Adjunct Professor of Biostatistics at McGill University. 


### Funding

My research is partially supported by NSERC through a Discovery Grant and a Discovery Launch Supplement Grant, by CIHR through a Project Grant, by the McGill Initiative in Computational Medicine through a Research Match Grant, by CANSSI through the Collaborative Research Teams Program, and by Mitacs through an Accelerate Grant.

### Research Opportunities

I have opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to assist with various research projects related to high-dimensional data, statistical genetics, imaging analysis and software development. I am looking for students with a background in (bio)statistics and/or computer science and knowledge of at least one of the following programming languages: R, Python, Julia, C++, shell scripting, PLINK. I am also open to co-supervise epidemiology students and medical residents who are seeking to answer clinically relevant questions with large databases.
